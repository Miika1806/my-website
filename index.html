			<h2>I'm Miika Nissi.</h2>
			<p>I am currently studying Information and communications technology at HAMK UAS, Finland.</p>
			<p>I'm originally from Nurmij√§rvi, Finland. I jump between New York & Finland on a regular basis.</p>
			<p>I've been interested in technology for a long time and I love learning more every day. I'm especially interested in open source software and I enjoy tinkering with Linux.</p>

			<h2>Here's a little bit about my hobbies.</h2>
			<p>I spent a lot of my childhood playing soccer, but nowadays I mainly focus on lifting weights. I enjoy the constant process of learning and improving in weightlifting and that mindset carries over to all aspects of my life.</p>
			<p>I also spend my free time playing video games, especially older games I grew up playing such as, Old School Runescape & Pokemon.</p>
			<p>Finally I of course enjoy programming on my free time and tinkering with software. Here are some projects I've done: </p>

			<h2>Text based web adventure game using Django/MySQL/JS</h2>
			<p>I got introduced to Django web framework in school and made a small project with it. It is an adventure game with MySQL database delivering you scenes based on your choices in the game. This was my first introduction to databases as well and I learnt a lot from it. In the future I'm hoping to learn more about delivering content to a web page using AJAX.</p>

			<h2>GUI app for shiny hunting in Pokemon</h2>
			<p>This project was a fun little GUI project after my first Java course. I learnt how to write GUIs in Java and to use an API for getting data for Pokemon objects.</p>
