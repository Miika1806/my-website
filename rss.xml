<p>After planning to make my own website for a good few months I finally got to making it live.</p>
<p>If you're reading this post it means I have succeeded. I originally made a working template with login and blog features, fully  working with the <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com"/>Django Web Framework</a>. Despite it being a working template I decided to go with something way more simple. I'm a big fan of KISS principle and Django is a lot of "bloat". </p>
<p>So I ended up with this website. I am running this on a virtual machine solely with Nginx. No complicated Databases, no PHP, no JavaScript, just a pure static html website.</p>
<p>The benefits of running a static website are great loading times, less vulnerabilites and perhaps more control on every aspect of the website. I also just like the simplicity.</p>
