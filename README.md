# my-website
This is how my website is made.
https://miikanissi.com

I made a static html/css only website, no JavaScript, no PHP, no big frameworks. Just an Nginx server serving static files. 

I modified a shell script from: https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/lb to fit my needs of writing blog posts.
