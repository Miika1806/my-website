<h1>Debian Spring(summer) Cleaning</h1>
<p>For the past few days or so I have been cleaning my desktop and organizing all of my dotfiles etc. I'm currently running Debian 10 buster with xfce DE. </p>
<p>The reason I'm doing this cleaning and organizing on my desktop is because I went ahead and threw out some cash for a new computer. I will make a blog post about that later when I get all the parts assembled. I am very excited for it and I think I will go ahead and do a rather minimal Debain/xfce install on it as well. </p>
<p>That's all from me today, just getting things ready for the new build.</p>
