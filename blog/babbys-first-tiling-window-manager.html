<h1>Babby's first Tiling Window Manager</h1>
<p>I had some spare time recently and I decided to configure a tiling window manager setup, I had noticed myself constantly resizing and moving my windows around so I thought it was time to finally start using a tiling window manager instead. </p>
<p>I have to say there are so many good ones out there it was very difficult to choose the right one for me, but I ended up going with BSPWM, which stands for ... no idea what it stands for. Regardless I liked the idea of modularity with it, BSPWM is simple just the window manager, it comes with no hotkeys, application launchers or navigation bars and it is up to the user to decide what they want to use for those. So in addition to BSPWM I also installed SXHKD, for hotkeys, Polybar for a task bar and Rofi for an application launcher. </p>
<p>I spent quite a few hours customizing my hotkeys, taskbar, scripts and colors, in the end I went with Hopscotch color scheme and made some improvements to my weather script. Here is the end result of my desktop: </p>
