<h1>New pc</h1>
<div class="even">

	<p>I received the parts for my new pc and put it together, the case is super small in person, perfect for my needs as I need to carry it in a plane often. </p>
	<p>I had a lot of fun putting this together and it was very easy actually, the case designs have come a long way from just a few years back.</p>
	<p>Here's a rough list of all the parts: </p>
	<ul>
		<li>Ryzen 5 3600</li>
		<li>Radeon RX570</li>
		<li>16gb DDR4 RAM</li>
		<li>ASRock B450 Mini-ITX</li>
		<li>Kingston 1tb A2000 NVMe</li>
		<li>Corsair SF450</li>
		<li>Kolink Rocket case</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Don't really have much more to say, this pc should be good for a good 5 years at least as I don't play too heavy games.</p>

	<p>I also installed Debian 10 on this machine again, it works like a charm.</p>
	<p>And as usual I spent the whole day finding the perfect color schemes, themes and wallpapers, the most important part!</p>
	<p>Only thing I'm missing in my setup is a good decentralized open source messaging platform, there isn't many good ones on the market.</p>
