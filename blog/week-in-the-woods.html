<h1>Week in the woods</h1>

	<p>My parents rented a cabin in the middle of Finland, the "Lake Finland", for a week for all of us to go there and relax for a bit. Here are some highlights of the trip. </p>
	<p>The cabin itself was a super cozy wooden cabin with 2 floors and enough sleeping room for 5 people. It also had central air which is very uncommon for a cabin in the middle of the woods but I didn't complain. </p>
	<p>The property also had a seperate wooden outdoors sauna. It was the best sauna I have ever been in. </p>

	<p>Of course a cabin in Lake Finland wouldn't be complete without a lake and deck to fish and swim from. I didn't go for a swim as the weather was only mid 50s for the week, but I spent most of the time fishing.</p>
	<p>The place was by no means a good fishing spot, the majority of catches were small perch that we just released back. But my highlight was catching a ~4 lb zander. </p>

	<p>Our cat, Momo, had the time of his life, he caught 3 mice, 2 salamander and a frog. I think he really enjoyed how quiet it was at the cabin, there were no car sounds or anything. </p>
	<p>I would love to buy my own cabin one day. I would really enjoy building and improving the cabin and just spending my summers there.. Maybe one day!</p>
