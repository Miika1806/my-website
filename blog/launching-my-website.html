<h1>Launching my website</h1>
<p>After planning to make my own website for a good few months I finally managed to release it.</p>
<p>If you're reading this post it means I have succeeded. I originally made a working template with login and blog features, fully  working with the <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com"/>Django Web Framework</a>. Despite it being a working template I decided to go with something way more simple. I'm a big fan of the KISS principle and Django is a very heavy duty framework. Not saying it wouldn't work for a small blog site, but there is also not much need for it. At least I got some practice in with Django :). </p>
<p>Now how does my website work then?</p>
<p>I am running this site on a virtual machine solely with Nginx. No complicated Databases, no PHP, no JavaScript, just a pure static html website.</p>
<p>In order to make blog posts and update my <a href="https://miikanissi.com/rss.xml">RSS feed.</a> I found a very helpful script by <a href="https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/lb">Luke Smith</a>. I modified his script slightly to fit my needs, but I have to give full credit to him.</p>
<p>The benefits of running a static website are great loading times, less vulnerabilites and perhaps more control on every aspect of the website. I also just like the simplicity.</p>
<p>If you want to see the source code for my website I have it on my <a href="https://github.com/Miika1806/my-website">Github</a>.</p>
